# Rotten Mangoes

My first app built with Rails during the Lighthouse Labs web development bootcamp. It is a Rotten Tomatoes clone styled with the Materialize CSS framework.

This was an individual project initially built over five days. An additional five days of part-time work was spent applying the Materialize style throughout the app and making it responsive.

A production version is hosted on Heroku at http://rmango.heroku.com/
